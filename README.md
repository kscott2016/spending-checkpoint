1 Project Description

1.1 Overview

We live in a time when digital innovations have given rise to technologies and processes that redefine our wants into needs for instant gratification.  In this era, ecommerce companies have arguably won the marketing race in understanding how to turn the most logical humans into rampant consumers.  Combined with daily stressors of work/family and we have the perfect environment for impulse internet shopping.

Problem Statement: People need to slow down when they find themselves "taking advantage of this great deal!".  At this point, the item(s) have already been added to their shopping carts.  Check out button(s) are even presented at multiple spots on the web page to make the instant gratification a reality.  This is where the chrome extension will slow down the process. 

Target Users: Chrome users who shop when experiencing any of the following: heightened stress, heightened emotional state (ex: anger, sadness, frustration), boredom, mentally altered states (such as alcohol consumption).
